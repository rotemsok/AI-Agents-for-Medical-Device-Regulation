# Regulatory Scope Matrix

This matrix defines baseline scoping for key jurisdictions. It is intended to drive planning and draft assembly, not to replace expert legal/regulatory judgment.

## Jurisdiction-to-Scope Mapping

| Jurisdiction | Core Deliverables | Approval Pathways (Typical) | Required Evidence Inputs |
|---|---|---|---|
| FDA (US) | 510(k) or De Novo submission package; device description; substantial equivalence or benefit-risk narrative; software documentation set (as applicable); labeling package; risk management summary; design controls evidence; verification/validation summary | 510(k), De Novo, PMA (higher risk) | Intended use and indications; predicate analysis (if 510(k)); design inputs/outputs; risk management file; V&V protocols/reports; software lifecycle artifacts; usability/human factors evidence; clinical evidence where required; labeling drafts |
| EU MDR (EU) | Technical Documentation (Annex II/III components); General Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPR) checklist; clinical evaluation documentation; post-market surveillance planning artifacts; risk management and benefit-risk records; labeling/IFU language set | CE marking via conformity assessment route based on classification (e.g., Annex IX/X/XI with Notified Body involvement where required) | Device classification rationale; intended purpose; GSPR mapping; risk management file; clinical evaluation and PMCF planning evidence; performance and safety test reports; usability evidence; QMS-aligned procedures; labeling/IFU artifacts |
| AMAR (Saudi Arabia) | Market authorization dossier package; device listing/registration information; conformity and safety evidence bundle; labeling/localization artifacts; post-market commitments evidence | National medical device marketing authorization route(s) under SFDA processes (path depends on device category and recognition options) | Manufacturer and authorized representative details; device description/intended use; prior approvals/certificates (if applicable); safety/performance test evidence; risk management artifacts; labeling (including local requirements); quality and post-market documentation |

## Cross-Jurisdiction Notes
- Deliverable composition and terminology vary by device class, technology, and updates to guidance.
- Pathway determination must be validated by RA/QA before authoring final submission text.
- Missing evidence must be identified as a blocking gap, not silently assumed.

## Hard Constraints Applied to Scope Decisions

1. **No fabricated data**
   - Scope outputs must reference actual supplied evidence only.
   - When evidence is unavailable, mark as “missing input required.”

2. **Human escalation required for real-world actions (tests/PO/submissions)**
   - The system can generate plans/checklists, but humans must authorize and execute:
     - test initiation/completion,
     - purchase order actions,
     - submission filing steps.

3. **Traceability from intake to generated sections**
   - Each matrix-derived drafting task must retain links to:
     - original intake question,
     - selected jurisdiction/pathway assumptions,
     - referenced evidence inputs,
     - reviewer approval history.
